ExamStats is a basic tool that I have written to generate exam statistics. It uses
an unformatted list of grades and points achieved by individual students and tries
to interpret the list and create an statistical dashboard based on the given data.

I have shut down the server which runs ExamStats. You can download the source code
here:
